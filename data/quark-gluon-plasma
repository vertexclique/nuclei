Quark–gluon plasma or QGP is an interacting localized assembly
of quarks and gluons at thermal (local kinetic) and (close to)
chemical (abundance) equilibrium. The word plasma signals that
free color charges are allowed. In a 1987-summary, Léon van
Hove pointed out the equivalence of the three terms: quark
gluon plasma, quark matter and a new state of matter.[2] Since
the temperature is above the Hagedorn temperature—and thus above
the scale of light u,d-quark mass—the pressure exhibits the
relativistic Stefan-Boltzmann format governed by fourth power of
temperature and many practically mass free quark and gluon constituents.
We can say that QGP emerges to be the new phase of strongly interacting
matter which manifests its physical properties in terms of nearly free
dynamics of practically massless gluons and quarks. Both quarks and gluons,
must be present in conditions near chemical (yield) equilibrium with their
colour charge open for a new state of matter to be referred to as QGP.
