const DARK_MATTER_TEXT: &'static str = "\
Dark matter is a form of matter thought to account for approximately \
85% of the matter in the universe and about a quarter of its total \
mass–energy density or about 2.241×10−27 kg/m3. Its presence is implied \
in a variety of astrophysical observations, including gravitational effects \
that cannot be explained by accepted theories of gravity unless more matter \
is present than can be seen. For this reason, most experts think that dark \
matter is abundant in the universe and that it has had a strong influence \
on its structure and evolution. Dark matter is called dark because it does \
not appear to interact with the electromagnetic field, which means it doesn't \
absorb, reflect or emit electromagnetic radiation, and is therefore difficult \
to detect.[1]\
